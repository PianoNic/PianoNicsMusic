-   **üîÑ Version Management:** Built-in versioning system with detailed release information.

## üöÄ Getting Started (Setup in 3 Steps)

Follow these steps to get your bot up and running.

### Step 1: Create Your Discord Bot

Before you can run the code, you need to create a "Bot Application" in Discord.

1.  Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and log in.
2.  Click **"New Application"** and give it a name (e.g., "My Music Bot").
3.  Go to the **"Bot"** tab on the left menu.
4.  Click **"Reset Token"** and then **"Yes, do it!"**.
5.  **Copy the token!** This is your `DISCORD_TOKEN`. Keep it safe.
6.  Go to the **"OAuth2" -> "URL Generator"** tab.
7.  Select the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes.
8.  In the "Bot Permissions" box that appears, select **"Connect"** and **"Speak"**.
9.  Copy the generated URL at the bottom, paste it into your browser, and invite the bot to your server.

### Step 2: Get the Necessary Files

You don't need to clone the whole repository to run the bot. You only need two files.

1.  Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., `my-music-bot`).
2.  Download the [`compose.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pianonic/PianoNicsMusic/main/compose.yml) file into that folder.
    *   *Right-click the link and "Save Link As..."*

### Step 3: Configure Your Bot

In the same folder, create a file named `.env` and add your credentials.

```properties
# Paste the bot token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN

# These are optional, but make Spotify links load 60% faster!
# Get them from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

> **Note:** The bot works without Spotify credentials, but they are recommended for the best performance with Spotify links.

## üì¶ Installation & Running the Bot

Choose one of the two methods below. Docker is the easiest and highly recommended.

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Easiest Method)

This method uses pre-built images from Docker Hub or GitHub, so you don't have to build anything. It's the fastest way to get started.

1.  **Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.**
2.  Open the `compose.yml` file you downloaded. It's already configured to pull the latest image. By default, it uses the image from Docker Hub:

    ```yaml
    services:
      pianonic-music-bot:
        # Pulls the latest image from Docker Hub
        image: pianonic/pianonicsmusic:latest
        # To use the GitHub image instead, comment the line above and uncomment this one:
        # image: ghcr.io/pianonic/pianonicsmusic:latest
        container_name: pianonic-music-bot
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

3.  **Run the bot with one command:**

    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

Docker will automatically download the latest version of the bot and run it in the background. Your bot is now online!

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced: Building the Docker Image from Source</strong></summary>

If you have cloned the full repository and made changes to the source code, you'll need to build the image yourself.

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Pianonic/PianoNicsMusic.git`
2.  Navigate into the directory: `cd PianoNicsMusic`
3.  Modify the `docker-compose.yml` to use the `build` command instead of `image`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      pianonic-music-bot:
        build:
          context: .
        container_name: pianonic-music-bot
        env_file: .env
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```
4.  Build and run your custom version:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```

</details>

### Option 2: Standard Python Setup (Manual)

Use this method if you prefer not to use Docker.

1.  **Clone the full repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Pianonic/PianoNicsMusic.git
    cd PianoNicsMusic
    ```
2.  **Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.**
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the bot:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

## üéß Usage: How to Use Commands

Control the bot with simple commands in your server's text channels.

### üéµ Music Playback

| Command | Aliases | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `play` | `p`, `add` | Plays a song, adds it to the queue, or loads a list of URLs from an attached file. | `play Never Gonna Give You Up`<br>`play` + file attachment |
| `pause` | `hold` | Pauses the currently playing song. | `pause` |
| `resume` | `unpause` | Resumes playback if paused. | `resume` |
| `force_play` | `fp` | Plays a song immediately after the current one finishes. | `force_play My Favorite Song`<br>`force_play` + file attachment |

### üá∂ Queue Management

| Command | Aliases | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `skip` | `next` | Skips the current song and plays the next in queue. | `skip` |
| `stop` | `leave` | Stops the music, clears the queue, and disconnects the bot. | `stop` |
| `loop` | `repeat` | Toggles looping for the entire queue. | `loop` |
| `shuffle` | | Toggles shuffle mode, randomizing the queue order. | `shuffle` |
| `bot_status` | `status`, `np` | Shows the current song and the upcoming queue. | `bot_status` |
| `queue` | `q`, `show_queue`, `list`, `queue_list` | Shows the current music queue. | `queue` |

### ü§ñ General Commands

| Command | Aliases | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `help` | `h`, `commands` | Shows a list of all available commands. | `help` |
| `ping` | | Checks the bot's response time to Discord. | `ping` |
| `information` | `v`, `version` | Displays the bot's version and system info. | `information` |

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

-   **Bot won't connect to voice channel?** Make sure you invited it with the correct permissions (Step 1.8) and that you are in a voice channel when you use the `play` command.
-   **Bot is offline?** If using Docker, run `docker-compose ps` to check the container status. If it's not running, check the logs with `docker-compose logs`.
-   **Songs fail to play?** The bot will automatically skip failed songs. This can happen if a song is region-locked or the source is unavailable.
