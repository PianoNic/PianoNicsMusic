## üé∂ What is PianoNic's Music Bot?

PianoNic's Music Bot is a versatile Discord bot designed to elevate the music experience on your server. It allows you to play your favorite tracks on command from virtually any source, offering unparalleled flexibility. It also includes a unique (and currently in-development) feature that uses a trained AI voice to play music, providing a novel and engaging musical experience.

## üåü Features

-   **üéµ Music Playback:** Play music directly in your Discord server's voice channels.
-   **üó£Ô∏è AI Voice Integration:** Use a trained AI voice to play music for a distinctive listening experience. (In development)
-   **üåê Universal Source Playback:** Play music from any source, including streaming services, URLs, and local files.
-   **üìú Queue System:** Manage music playback with an intuitive queue system‚Äîadd, remove, or skip tracks effortlessly.
-   **üëå Easy Commands:** Simple, user-friendly commands for controlling music playback and utilizing AI voice features.
-   **üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Error Handling:** Robust error recovery prevents the bot from getting stuck during playback issues.
-   **üìä Status Monitoring:** Real-time bot status and queue information commands.
-   **üîÑ Version Management:** Built-in versioning system with detailed release information.

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Pianonic/PianoNicsMusic.git
cd PianoNicsMusic
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure the Bot

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```properties
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_TOKEN
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

To get your Spotify credentials, visit the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/apps) to create an application.

> **Note:** Providing Spotify credentials is **optional**. The bot will still function without them. However, when credentials are provided, the bot will load Spotify songs **60% faster**, as it can directly access Spotify's API for optimized track info retrieval.

### 4. Run the Bot

```sh
python main.py
```

## üê≥ Docker Setup

### Build the Docker Image

```sh
docker build -t pianonic-music-bot .
```

### Run the Docker Container

```sh
docker run -d --name pianonic-music-bot pianonic-music-bot
```

### Using Docker Compose (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` for simplified container management:

```yaml
services:
  pianonic-music-bot:
    build:
      context: .
    container_name: pianonic-music-bot
    environment:
      - DISCORD_TOKEN=${DISCORD_TOKEN}
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=${SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID}
      - SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=${SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET}
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Then, run it with:

```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

-   **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Playing Music:** Use the `play` command followed by the song name, URL, or file path to queue music.

### üéõÔ∏è Queue Management

- **Shuffle Mode:** Use `shuffle` to randomize playback order

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Bot gets stuck and won't play the next song:**
- This has been fixed in v1.2.0 with enhanced error handling
- Use the `skip` command to force move to the next song
- Use `bot_status` to check the current queue state

**Bot won't connect to voice channel:**
- Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your Discord server
- Make sure you're in a voice channel when using the `play` command
- Check that the bot has "Connect" and "Speak" permissions

**Songs fail to play:**
- The bot will automatically skip failed songs and continue with the queue
- Check your internet connection
- Some URLs might be region-restricted or unavailable

**Database issues:**
- The bot now uses a persistent database (`bot_data.db`)
- If issues persist, you can safely delete this file to reset the bot's state

### Getting Help

- Use the `help` command to see all available commands
- Use `bot_status` to check the current bot state
- Use `version` to check your bot version and ensure you have the latest updates
